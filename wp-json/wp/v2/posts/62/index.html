Fortunately, many of the problems associated with bad back or literal pain in the neck have been treated by the medical industry with great strides. Back and neck pain are some of the most common reasons for millions of Americans for disability, missed work and absolutely miserable days and nights. Fortunately, many of the problems associated with bad back or literal pain in the neck have been treated by the medical industry with great strides. Consider the following list of the ten most common causes of back pain and neck pain to gain a better understanding of how these things can happen to anyone at any time and wherever possible avoid them. 10 Most common reasons for back and neck pain\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>10 of the main causes of back and neck pain<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Old Age. <\/strong>All right, everything depends on your old perspective. If you&#8217;re young enough, you might think 35 are old, and we&#8217;re not talking about that here. The fact is, however, that many people over the age of 50 have lower back pain. It is mainly caused by a gradual degeneration of the joints in the spine caused by osteoarthritis and spinal stenosis.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Sports. <\/strong>We hate age, but playing high-impact sports such as basketball, soccer and other similarly rigorous athletic activities is much better suited for children and young adults than people in their 40s, 50s and beyond. While these activities are still a healthy idea for anyone of any age, they pose a risk of pain in the neck and back. Proceed with due awareness and caution. If you continue to have problems performing such athletics, consider more low-impact activities such as swimming or cycling.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Sleep. <\/strong>Sleeping in awkward positions can cause nasty pain in the neck the next morning. It can be bad for your back to sleep on your stomach. The best option is usually to use a therapeutic pillow while avoiding any uncomfortable force on the neck or back during the night.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Poor Posture. <\/strong>Cyber employees today are not ideal for a healthy neck and back. While sitting at a computer terminal or driving to the office, the posture that involves craning your neck forward is a big culprit for neck and back pain. Get up and move about every 20-30 minutes to exercise and stretch your spine if possible.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fender Benders. <\/strong>The morning travel is filled with people who drive with one eye open from a lack of sleep and one hand on a cup of coffee to try to rectify the situation. This is a big fender bender waiting to happen in the stop-and-go traffic of today&#8217;s overcrowded morning commutes. These little &#8220;taps&#8221; on the back of your car can cause a whiplash that causes the head and neck to plunge at high speed.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Herniated Disc. <\/strong>This condition can cause no noticeable symptoms if you&#8217;re lucky. If you&#8217;re not as lucky, you may need a moderate medical procedure. Pain from a herniated disc occurs when one of the disks in your spine between the vertebrae is damaged and irritates the nerve nearby. If you suspect that your pain is from a herniated disk, seek help from a doctor who can perform a minimally invasive procedure to easily rectify this situation. These exercises can also be tried to help deal with degenerative disk disease.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Forget Me Not. <\/strong>Even something as routine and harmless as taking the trash out or playing in the backyard with the kids can cause neck and back pain if you&#8217;re not careful. Perform physical activity at all times with care. If possible, never twist, bend or reach from an awkward position.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fracture. <\/strong>There is a possibility of fracture from osteoporosis in older adults, especially postmenopausal women. Anything that exerts a little extra force on the spine can cause a fracture of the hairline &#8211; perhaps something as routine as a sneeze.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Overweight. <\/strong>Nothing puts too much pressure on your spine. Consult your doctor for a healthy program consisting of a sensible diet with mild to moderate exercise in order to avoid problems with the neck or back caused by excessive weight gain.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Poor Lifting Form. <\/strong><span class=\"word\">Keep <\/span><span class=\"word\">your <\/span><span class=\"word\">back <\/span><span class=\"word\">straight <\/span><span class=\"word\">and <\/span><span class=\"word\">your <\/span><span class=\"word\">legs <\/span><span class=\"word\">bend. <\/span><span class=\"word\">Engage <\/span><span class=\"word\">your <\/span><span class=\"word\">abdominal <\/span><span class=\"word\">muscles, <\/span><span class=\"word\">don&#8217;t <\/span><span class=\"word\">twist, <\/span><span class=\"word\">and <\/span><span class=\"word\">don&#8217;t <\/span><span class=\"word\">lift <\/span><span class=\"word\">more <\/span><span class=\"word\">than <\/span><span class=\"word\">20% <\/span><span class=\"word\">of <\/span><span class=\"word\">your <\/span><span class=\"word\">body <\/span><span class=\"word\">weight. <\/span><span class=\"word\">Breaking <\/span><span class=\"word\">any <\/span><span class=\"word\">of <\/span><span class=\"word\">these <\/span><span class=\"word\">rules <\/span><span class=\"word\">significantly <\/span><span class=\"word\">increases <\/span><span class=\"word\">your <\/span><span class=\"word\">risk <\/span><span class=\"word\">of <\/span><span class=\"word\">injury, <\/span><span class=\"word\">especially <\/span><span class=\"word\">if <\/span><span class=\"word\">you&#8217;re <\/span><span class=\"word\">older <\/span><span class=\"word\">(I&#8217;m <\/span><span class=\"word\">sorry <\/span><span class=\"word\">to <\/span><span class=\"word\">stay <\/span><span class=\"word\">in <\/span><span class=\"word\">the <\/span><span class=\"word\">age). <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span class=\"ILfuVd\">Most massage techniques are designed to promote pain relief, stress reduction, and improved movement in daily living. Therapeutic massage has been shown to improve joint flexibility, relieve lower-back pain, and stimulate the release of endorphins.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s Sense Spa in Dubai provides body massage which is completely relaxing as well as refreshment to the body.
